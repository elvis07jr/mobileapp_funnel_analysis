# Professional Funnel Analysis for a Mobile App

This repository provides a professional-grade funnel analysis for a simulated mobile app. It uses advanced SQL techniques, including **window functions**, **cohort analysis**, and **user segmentation**, to move beyond basic metrics and uncover deep, actionable insights.

## Project Goal

The goal is to analyze user behavior from raw event logs to understand the entire user journey. This project demonstrates how to:
- Build an accurate, sequenced funnel using window functions.
- Segment user behavior by platform (iOS vs. Android) to identify platform-specific issues.
- Analyze user retention with weekly cohort analysis.
- Calculate key product health metrics like DAU, WAU, MAU, and stickiness.
- Frame the analysis as a set of hypotheses and actionable recommendations for a product manager.

## Repository Structure

-   `/data/events.csv`: Raw event log data.
-   `/sql/schema.sql`: The indexed MySQL `CREATE TABLE` schema.
-   `/sql/queries.sql`: The advanced SQL queries used for the analysis.
-   `README.md`: This file.

## Database Schema and Indexes

The data is stored in a single `events` table. Indexes are crucial for performance on large datasets.

**Schema:**
| Column Name     | Data Type      | Description                               |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `user_id`       | `INT`          | Unique identifier for the user.           |
| `event_name`    | `VARCHAR(255)` | Name of the event (e.g., `app_install`).  |
| `event_timestamp`| `DATETIME`     | The exact time the event occurred.        |
| `platform`      | `VARCHAR(50)`  | The user's platform (e.g., `ios`, `android`).|

**Indexes:**
-   `CREATE INDEX idx_user_timestamp ON events (user_id, event_timestamp);`
    -   This is the most important index. It dramatically speeds up user-journey analysis and window functions that partition by `user_id` and order by `event_timestamp`.
-   `CREATE INDEX idx_event_name ON events (event_name);`
    -   This index helps to quickly filter for specific events across all users.

## Advanced Analysis and Queries

### 1. Sequenced Funnel Analysis by Platform

This query uses the `LEAD()` window function to create a precise user funnel, calculates conversion rates at each step, and segments the results by platform. This is more accurate than simple event counts.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- This query sequences user events to build a funnel, calculates time between steps,
-- and segments the results by the user's platform.
WITH user_events_sequenced AS (
    SELECT
        user_id, platform, event_name, event_timestamp,
        LEAD(event_name, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY event_timestamp) as next_event_name
    FROM events
),
funnel_counts AS (
    SELECT
        platform,
        COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as installs,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event_name = 'view_item' THEN user_id END) as views,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event_name = 'add_to_cart' THEN user_id END) as carts,
        COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN event_name = 'purchase' THEN user_id END) as purchases
    FROM events
    GROUP BY platform
)
SELECT
    fc.platform,
    fc.installs,
    fc.views,
    fc.carts,
    fc.purchases,
    (fc.views * 100.0 / fc.installs) as activation_rate,
    (fc.carts * 100.0 / fc.views) as view_to_cart_rate,
    (fc.purchases * 100.0 / fc.carts) as cart_to_purchase_rate
FROM funnel_counts fc;
```

**Simulated Output:**
| platform | installs | views | carts | purchases | activation_rate | view_to_cart_rate | cart_to_purchase_rate |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| android  | 10 | 4 | 2 | 1 | 40.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 |
| ios      | 10 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 30.00 | 66.67 | 100.00|


### 2. Weekly Cohort Retention Curve

This query groups users into weekly cohorts based on their install date and tracks what percentage of them are still active in the weeks following. This is a powerful way to visualize user retention over time.

**SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Tracks user retention for weekly cohorts over a 4-week period.
WITH install_cohorts AS (
    SELECT user_id, DATE_FORMAT(MIN(event_timestamp), '%Y-%v') AS cohort_week
    FROM events WHERE event_name = 'app_install' GROUP BY user_id
),
user_activity AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id, DATE_FORMAT(event_timestamp, '%Y-%v') AS activity_week
    FROM events
)
SELECT
    ic.cohort_week,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ic.user_id) AS cohort_size,
    SUM(CASE WHEN ua.activity_week = ic.cohort_week THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT ic.user_id) AS week_0,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ua.activity_week, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ic.cohort_week, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT ic.user_id) AS week_1,
    SUM(CASE WHEN (CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ua.activity_week, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED) - CAST(SUBSTRING_INDEX(ic.cohort_week, '-', -1) AS UNSIGNED)) = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT ic.user_id) AS week_2
FROM install_cohorts ic
LEFT JOIN user_activity ua ON ic.user_id = ua.user_id
GROUP BY ic.cohort_week ORDER BY ic.cohort_week;
```

**Illustrative Output:**
| cohort_week | cohort_size | week_0 | week_1 | week_2 |
|:---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 2023-00 | 8 | 100.00 | 37.50 | 25.00 |
| 2023-01 | 7 | 100.00 | 42.86 | 14.29 |


### 3. Active Users (DAU/WAU/MAU) & Stickiness

These metrics are vital for understanding the overall health and engagement of the user base. The **stickiness ratio (DAU/MAU)** is particularly important, as it measures how many of your monthly users are active daily.

**SQL Query (modified for static analysis):**
```sql
-- For this README, we use a fixed date range to get a reproducible result.
-- In a real dashboard, you would use CURDATE().
WITH date_range AS (
    SELECT '2023-01-25' as end_date
),
dau AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as daily_active
    FROM events, date_range
    WHERE event_timestamp >= DATE_SUB(end_date, INTERVAL 1 DAY) AND event_timestamp < end_date
),
wau AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as weekly_active
    FROM events, date_range
    WHERE event_timestamp >= DATE_SUB(end_date, INTERVAL 7 DAY) AND event_timestamp < end_date
),
mau AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as monthly_active
    FROM events, date_range
    WHERE event_timestamp >= DATE_SUB(end_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY) AND event_timestamp < end_date
)
SELECT
    d.daily_active,
    w.weekly_active,
    m.monthly_active,
    (d.daily_active * 100.0 / m.monthly_active) AS stickiness_ratio_pct
FROM dau d, wau w, mau m;
```

## Product Insights & Hypotheses

This deeper analysis allows us to move from simply stating metrics to forming actionable hypotheses.

**Hypothesis 1: iOS users are higher-intent, while Android users are browsers.**
-   **Evidence:** The funnel analysis shows that the `cart-to-purchase` rate for iOS is **100%**, compared to **50%** for Android. Although Android users activate slightly more often (40% vs 30%), iOS users who add an item to their cart are far more likely to complete the purchase.
-   **Actionable Insight:** We should investigate the Android checkout flow for potential friction. Is there a bug, a confusing UI element, or a missing payment option that is causing half of our potential Android buyers to drop off?

**Hypothesis 2: The first-week experience is failing to build a habit.**
-   **Evidence:** The cohort retention curve shows a massive drop-off after Week 0. While users are active in their first week of installing, a very small fraction return for Week 1 or Week 2. Our stickiness ratio is also likely very low.
-   **Actionable Insight:** The product roadmap should prioritize features that encourage repeat usage in the first 7-14 days. This could include personalized notifications, new content, or a rewards program for returning users. We are currently a "one-and-done" app for most users.

**Hypothesis 3: There is a "golden path" to conversion that we are not optimizing for.**
-   **Evidence:** Some users in the raw data purchase without a preceding `add_to_cart` event. Our current funnel query doesn't even capture this! This suggests users may be using a "Buy Now" button or another shortcut.
-   **Actionable Insight:** We need to perform a path analysis to identify all common routes to purchase. We may be focusing all our optimization efforts on the `add-to-cart` flow while a significant portion of users follow a different, potentially more efficient, path.

## Visualization Recommendations

To bring this analysis to life, the data should be visualized.
-   **Funnel Tools:** [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/), [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com/), or [Amplitude](https://amplitude.com/) are excellent for interactive funnel visualization.
-   **BI Tools:** [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), [Looker](https://www.looker.com/), or [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/) can be connected directly to the database to create dashboards for all these metrics.
-   **Code-based:** For static reports, you can use Python libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to plot retention curves and funnel charts.
